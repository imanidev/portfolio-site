# My Portfolio Site

This is my portfolio site showcasing my projects and skills. It is built with React + Vite and hosted on Vercel. 

You can view the site [here](https://imani-dev-portfolio.vercel.app/).

## Inspiration

I was inspired by the classic terminal theme. It's something about the classic green and black that gets me into code mode. 

I wanted to create a portfolio site that was easy to navigate and maintain. Which is why I decided to use React and Vite to build the site due React's component based architecture and Vite's fast build times.
